# StewartDelta
toolchanging delta printer,  
By giving each delta linkage its own axis, we can turn the toolhead into an upside down stewart platform giving us 6 directions of freedom. Then by placing hotends tilted outwards in a circle we can achive toolswap times so fast the limiting factor is the hotend heattime not the swapp itself
